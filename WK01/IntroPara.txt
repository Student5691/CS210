I am Mason, I completed my undergrad in Chemical Engineering in 2014, join the Navy afterwards and did about 10 years there. I just got out and secured VA funding to pursue a master's in Comp Sci. I'm clearing undergrad requirements this year to hopefully start SDSU's grad program next fall. I'm very new to Comp Sci, having completed some community college programing courses over the last year to be allowed into CS 210. I've always been a nerd at heart and mystified by how computers actually work; together those have led me down this path. I am most looking forward to learning code optimization (space and time complexity, and using the right data structures at the right time) as well as learning the core fundamentals which will allow me to be a proper software developer by the end of this journey.
